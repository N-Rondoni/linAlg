To run this code, type 

make clean
make

This make step takes all text generated by the executable (LinAl.exe) and write it into output.txt. 

This output.txt should answer every question asked for.


If you want to change the degree of polynomial fitting, the variable d is found in a couple modules. Namely, in the driver routine Driver_LinAl.f90, and the modules vanderMaker, backsubChol. Both of the modules are found in LinAl.f90

simply change d in these three places, run make clean, then make, and all should work. Currently d is such that it produces a polynomial degree d-1.
