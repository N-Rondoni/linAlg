Hi Ian, 

Here's a short readme to ensure you can find everything needed.

Within my report directory you will find two reports, one for the computational section and one for the theory section. They are named to reflect this. 

Within my code directory you will find my FORTRAN, python, and Mathematica code.

The Fortran code is entirely handled by the executable LinAl.exe, with the output of this executable dumped into output.txt. 
Each section's results are clearly broken up and readable, all answers asked for can be found there. 

The python code does not plot the desired plane. This is frustrating because I am able to show the points on the exact same plane via Mathematica, so
for some reason python is not plotting the correct plane. In my computational report you can find pictures generated from mathematica, I hope this is sufficient. 
I really did try to use python - please let me know if you see where I went wrong I'd love to fix it! I supplied the mathematica code, though you probably won't
have a way to run it, just so you can see I really did program it up. 


What a brutal assignment, time to open a beer. Thanks for all your help through out!

Cheers,

Nick
