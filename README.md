# Numerical Methods

This repository contains recreations of most major numerical methods in linear algebra, such as QR factorization. The primary langauge is Fortran, with some plotting done in python and mathematica. 
Since fortran is a compiled language, the scripts are lightening fast. 

Originally a repository for AM 213a, numerical linear algebra, Winter 2022. Moved from gitlab to github in 2025, which removed verison history unfortunately.
