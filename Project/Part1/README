In both prob_a and prob_b subdirectories, to run the code simply type

make clean

make

which will produce and run the executable. All answers for varying subproblems are generated by the driver. 

In prob_a, this generates 8 data files filled with the appropriate reconstructions of the matrix. Errors or singular values can be printed depending on what you uncomment/comment out. Currently singular values are printed.

In prob_b, output.txt will be populated with the desired answers (e.g., iteration count, error for a particular method and matrix).
